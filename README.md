# Roll your own auth

Copy & paste code to roll your own auth easily and for free

## Side note
We recommend that you use a third party service that has proven over time to be robust, secure and scalable.

The issue is that it's really hard to find such criterias in a third party service, so rather than put your trust and money on such services that often times encounter security breaches and you suffer the consequences, it's better to roll your own auth initially then as your user base and team grows, it's much better to use a self hosted robust, scalable and secure auth system if any exists.

You can use this in order to build your own auth system.
